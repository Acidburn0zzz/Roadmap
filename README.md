Confirmed issues

System
------		
	[Major] rel notes: Announce that mint4win is discontinued
	[Major] upgrade notes: Explain how to remove priority 700 for PPA
	[Major] Update all translations
	[Major] can't install in EFI mode without Internet connection
	[Medium] libdvdcss2: DVD Playback doesn't work with new gstreamer: The stream is in the wrong format (using Totem).. works with VLC
	[Minor] cinnamon: inserting an Audio CD suggests Brasero and VLC, not Banshee
	[Minor] banshee: tries to rip a CD to FLAC by default
	can't install picasa from repositories
	cannot install Google Earth, or Teamviewwer. This may be an upstream issue though, as I understand that the ia32-libs file has been inexplicably removed from the Ubuntu repos. Is there a fix or a workaround for this in the pipeline? http://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=90&t=150730
	The add-apt-repository command doesn’t work with “gksu” and “pkexec” which causes various scripts that require this to break under Linux Mint 16 (Y PPA Manager tool for instance).
	rel_notes: for skype explain to add :i386 versions of libasound2 and libasound2-plugins or to install with --install-recommends
