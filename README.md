---------------------------	 
	
	little things		
		right-click Run/Open with blah in nemo, on executable files		
		applets: Even after setting org.cinnamon.desktop.lockdown.disable-lock-screen to true, the lock button still appears on cinnamon menu appletâ€¦
		applets: Can't minimize windows which have a modal dialog (for example: Synaptic while installing a package). It's possible via the titlebar, but not via the window list
		prefs: I miss the working WIN+D keyboard shortcut to go to desktop.
		nemo: package description for nemo-data it reads  "Nemo is the official file manager and graphical shell for the GNOME desktop."
		cinnamon: Onscreen keyboard activates when clicking the menu on the panel because text entry is focused... if onboard is used, entry should not focus when showing the menu 		
		when 'open menu when i move my mouse over it' is enabled, the tooltip still shows when i move the mouse over the menu		

	descoped:
