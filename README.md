Bugs found in Mint 15 RC
=======================================================================
                                           
2  System
---------
    
    - Install smplayer2 for DVD playback?
    - No EFI El-Torito entry in the ISO. Verified with "dumpet -i file.iso". Ubuntu can boot on UEFI. Mint only has 0Ã—00, so it only boots on BIOS(or CSM for UEFI) but not UEFI.

Upcoming
=======================================================================

Cinnamon
--------

    - Nemo: Add devices to MoveTo/CopyTo context menu
    - Nemo: when the breadcrumb is full, and you use the back button to show the start of it.. the forward button doesn't do anything so you can't get back to the end. Also, the last two items on the first page are not clickable.
    - Desklet position is lost after killing MDM

MDM 1.2
-------
    
    - Performance improvements
    - HTML Greeter: When there's a lot of languages the whole theme itself gets a scrollbar instead of just the language menu
    
Mint 16
-------

    - UI Improvements for Software Management    
    - Check if xterm is needed (by xinit)
    - update ubiquity-slideshow (mentions vlc, giver, pdf printer etc..)


=======================================================================
Long term
=======================================================================

Cinnamon 2.0
------------

 - Calendar events - similar to KDE's implementation [lockjs]
 - Configurable color schemes for themes    
 - Upgrade Menu applet with mintMenu features (highlight new apps, install/remove apps, search the Web) [clem]
 - Rethink Cinnamon 2D, fallback to a non-shadow CPU-less intensive session in software rendering mode and/or Muffin/OpenBox (whatever happens, the user should know he's not running the "real" Cinnamon, he should be told why, and he should find himself with a working WM (even a minimalistic one like OpenBox)).
 - Use bumpmaps, make them optional, make compositing optional if possible

    NEW APPLETS
    
    - email notifier (imap/pop)
    - Pulse-like RSS reader
    
    NEW DESKLETS
    
    - System monitor

Nemo 2.0
--------

    - File preview

R&D
---        
    - Add ubiquity features to live-installer (better partitioning, fs support, EFI, OEM..etc)
