	x-caja-desktop fix for Petra and Maya


Mint 17
--------------------
	KDE: 
		The installer doesn't install language-pack-gnome-xx resulting in GTK apps/dialogs showing in English
		also xfce, mdm: When loggin in an existing session, doesn't unlock kde screensaver, xscreensaver or gnome-screensaver (works fine with cinnamon-screensaver and mate-screensaver)
		Consider not using oxygen for GTK (check with mintBackup filechooser)	
		mintbackup, mintnanny, mintupload, mintdrivers, mintsources: remove KDE adjustment, add a specific KDE .desktop file
		missing mint-mdm-themes-kde
	xfce:

		missing indicator-sound indicator-sound-gtk2
			
	Cinnamon/MATE:

Cinnamon 2.2
---------------------------	 
	
	little things		
		right-click Run/Open with blah in nemo, on executable files		
		applets: Even after setting org.cinnamon.desktop.lockdown.disable-lock-screen to true, the lock button still appears on cinnamon menu appletâ€¦
		applets: Can't minimize windows which have a modal dialog (for example: Synaptic while installing a package). It's possible via the titlebar, but not via the window list
		prefs: I miss the working WIN+D keyboard shortcut to go to desktop.
		nemo: package description for nemo-data it reads  "Nemo is the official file manager and graphical shell for the GNOME desktop."
		cinnamon: Onscreen keyboard activates when clicking the menu on the panel because text entry is focused... if onboard is used, entry should not focus when showing the menu 		
		when 'open menu when i move my mouse over it' is enabled, the tooltip still shows when i move the mouse over the menu		
		cinnamon tooltips sometimes show at 0x0
		cinnamon panel icon size sometimes show huge icons unless panel-scale-text-icons is set to true..
		cinnamon-settings-daemon sometimes crash when failing to mount and we dismiss the error dialog

	descoped:
		consider using bernard's theme
		show frequency in displays
		screenshot filenames aren't handy (Screenshot from 2014-02-17 14:46:32.png)
		Add common tiling options to window list context menu - Show Windows Side by Side, Cascade, Show windows stacked
		cinnamon-bluetooth: bring compatibility to GNOME 3.10
		cinnamon-settings-users: add support for nopasswdlogin
		expo: set overview mode to true by default
		expo: lag on dnd
		network applet https://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-control-center/commit/panels/network?id=63756458b2de0d730763cc2acbd510659e4d00a5
		cinnamon-screensaver dialog is all shrunk in hi-dpi
