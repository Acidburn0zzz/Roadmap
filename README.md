		artwork/config:
			review isolinux
			New artwork

		system:
			Restore brightness settings on reboot (killswitch does that for bluetooth state)
			add "pwfeedback" to Defaults line in sudoers file, to show *** feedback when typing password

		mate 1.14:
			touchpad: tap actions should reflect click actions
			mcc: replace sound themes with sound events
			multi-monitor: caja doesn't always show the desktop on the primary monitor (using a laptop as main/left monitor, and HDMI screen with higher res on the right, it surprisingly ends up showing icons on the right screen)

		cinnamon 3.0:
			touchpad: tap actions should reflect click actions
			multi-monitor: add an option to suspend on lid-close EVEN when external monitors are plugged
			sound: add an option to switch sound to HDMI when an HDMI output device is plugged
			menu: search on non-accentuated versions (for instance, "method" should find mintlocale's im in French)
			hidpi issues: top of mint menu is cut off in HiDPI (1920Ã—1280)
			gnome-system-monitor moves out of place in Expo
			when battery is very low, battery icon isn't red.. 2% charge, with less than 5 minutes to go, still not red.. bar is red in CCC, icon is red in notification.. but not in applet (and also not in the CCC icon itself either)
			When using Cinnamon bar at top, and secondary monitor with higher height than the main display, some apps like KDE Apps (Krita, Kdenlive) or Wine Based Apps (teamviewer) will display menus from toolbar in the wrong place. Being more specific: The menus will be displayed in the position that they should be displayed at main monitor, however in this case the window is maximized in the secondary monitor.
			hovering over notifications which have buttons/widgets should not dim them ...
			accessibility: ability to select files by hovering them

		mintupdate:
			unattended updates? at least provide a CLI to do it via cron?
			fix mergelist issues directly in mintupdate or checkAPT

		mintinstall: when apt cache is missing, it just says not available. Instead it could tell the user or even help the user to refresh the cache.
		mintmenu: dark themes https://github.com/linuxmint/mintmenu/issues/87
