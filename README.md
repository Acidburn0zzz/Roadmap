Confirmed issues

KDE
---
	[Fixed] mintstick KDE action shows also for DVD and floppy disks		

Xfce
----
    Xfce doesn't seem to detect DVD insertion, doesn't run VLC (works in 32bit, not 64bit)
	Can't use the trash in live mode    
	There are no GTK bookmarks by default

Mint 17
-------	
	mdm: In OEM mode, MDM preselects the "oem" user (user no longer active but still present in AccountsServices) :)
	mdm: When loggin in an existing session, doesn't unlock kde screensaver, xscreensaver or gnome-screensaver (works fine with cinnamon-screensaver and mate-screensaver)
	system: switch to adobe-flashplugin
	banshee: use mp3 decoding by default
	cinnamon: enable touchpad tapping by default
	mintbackup, mintnanny, mintupload, mintdrivers, mintsources: remove KDE adjustment, add a specific KDE .desktop file
	mintdesktop: When Compiz is active with MATE, WM preferences have to go to Metacity gconf settings instead of Marco ones to work.
	mintdrivers: should we re-add a systray icon to notify users at session startup?
