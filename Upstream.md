Bugs depending on apps outside of Mint, many of these are solvables by the team but some others might depend on the other projects

Upstream bugs
--------

	docky: cinnamon-settings shows a bluetooth icon in docky (docky scans /usr/share/application for Exec=processname.. in the case of cinnamon-settings, its first positive match is "Exec=cinnamon-settings bluetooth")

	kdeenlive: missing german translations.

	gnome-calculator: huge context menu
