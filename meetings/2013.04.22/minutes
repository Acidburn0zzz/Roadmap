Decisions

- The GNOME 3.8 support pull request was finalized, but not merged. It's in Arch already but it won't go in Cinnamon 1.8 per se (as it brings nothing to 3.4/3.6 users and presents a risk for regressions close to the 1.8 release).
- It was decided no release dates would be announced for Cinnamon 1.8. The new release will happen when the Roadmap is cleared.
- Cinnamon was Feature Frozen, only bug fixes are going in.
