New bug reports in Mint 16 RC

	mate-system-monitor under recourses doesn’t look great with the default GTK theme
	After Installing an application, the category icons in mint-menu do not show
	mate-terminal still has a menu bar and is not transparent
	The notification will sometimes appear in the bottom right corner of the screen in a position it will be invisible
	Clicking “help” on most mate applications opens yelp to an error page
	MATE sound preview not work correctly, bug is like on LMDE before some package updates – file manager just disappear and sound continues play.
	Not yet fixed MATE mintMenu bug where it isn’t transparent when user set panel with solid color – all panel adjusts transparent but mintMenu remains with default gray color.
	Mate power manager doesn’t force computer to suspend / hibernate when running on battery and the settings are set to sleep after a set period of time. This feature does work when running on a/c.
	x-caja-desktop issue when opening “Trash” from the menu.
	Mintmenu has a scrolling problem when the ALL-Tab was clicked and dragged quickly. This is a small problem.
	In the Mint menu, “Applications” is still badly translated in french. It should be replaced by “Logiciels” instead of “Applications” that means nothing. In the other applet menu (not default Mint menu), the translation is fine, see http://nsa33.casimages.com/img/2013/05/01/130501011029467213.png
	If you add a few keyboard layouts and set the CapsLock key to switch them, after reboot CapsLock stops switching the layouts.
	If you set a black wallpaper, the text below desktop icons becomes unvisible after reboot or logout and login. It appears even in LiveCD mode (set black wallpaper, logout, wait for login, see).
	Two ‘Network’ items in mate-session-properties.
	1. Open caja window 2. Click right mouse to some file or dir, select Properties. 3. Go to Emblems tab, enable some emblem, press Close. 4. Click right mouse to the file/dir, select Properties. 5. Go to Emblems tab, disable the enabled emblem, press Close. 6. Caja is crashed.
	i dont see dng and raw images thumbnails in caja
	network settings forgets DNS entries	
	I cannot set the pointer size. The slider in Appearance/Customize/Pointer is greyed out
	Regardless how I set the screen shut down in Power Management, it always shuts down after a very short time. I tried ‘Never” and ’1 hour” but it did not work.
	Could not install network printer.
	mate panel doesn’t do autohide after locking and unlocking screen.
