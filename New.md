New bug reports in Mint 17 RC

All editions
-------------		
	Could not install “refracta snapshot” due to “live-config” not able to be installed. This is a deal-breaker for me as I use Refracta Tools.
	newly created used with no password set, can log in but can't log out (MDM autoselects it)


Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #349
---------------------------------------------					
	Nemo conflicts with fcitx, the best chinese input method. I can’t rename anything in Nemo with fcitx.
	the zoom doesn’t zoom IN on a reboot after you activate it. however, if you first zoom OUT, all works as advertised after that.	
	Cinnamon isn’t scaling user defined panel sizes properly. If I select Numix as my theme and set a customised panel size, when clicking Allow Cinnamon to Scale Panel Text and Icons, the text on the right side of the panel bar seems to go a bit blurry. This didn’t happen on the last release. The update shield sometimes goes wonky too which I assume is related.
	Unable to import a VPN config file (openvpn) into Network
	The power button set to “shut down immediately” still ‘asks’
	Bluetooth headset connects, but cannot stream audio and does not show up in pulseaudio as valid output device.
	Battery applet not showing time or percentage.
	battery applet tooltip is AC Adapter?
	pidgin status icon is not displayed. I have to do Alt+F2 -> “r” to make it visible.
	desktop icons text color is too dark and barely visible on a dark background

-----------------------------------------	
	some of the MATE applications don’t have a mint-x icon. engrampa, eye of mate, atril. They could use the GNOME icons.
