	dual monitors full screen issue: https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/4215

	Error with scale and expo in hot corners (tested in a VM): If you have one screen, two panels, the top hot corners don’t work (even with pointer pass through on). In 3.6.8 it’s worse than in 3.6.7.

	When attempting to connect to a WPA/WPA2-Enterprise network using either the NetworkManager panel applet or Network Settings dialogue. Expected behavior is that a configuration dialogue for security settings (identity, password, CA cert, etc.) should pop up, allowing user to configure network. NM should then connect to the network. Actual behavior is that NM displays the “connecting to network” animation but never connects, pops up the security dialogue, or gives any error message (at least in the GUI). However, configuring the same WPA2 Enterprise connection through the “Connect to a Hidden Network” dialogue (i.e., manually) works as expected.
