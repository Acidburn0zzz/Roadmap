Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #146
---------------------------------------------					
	Nemo conflicts with fcitx, the best chinese input method. I can’t rename anything in Nemo with fcitx.
	the zoom doesn’t zoom IN on a reboot after you activate it. however, if you first zoom OUT, all works as advertised after that.	
	Cinnamon isn’t scaling user defined panel sizes properly. If I select Numix as my theme and set a customised panel size, when clicking Allow Cinnamon to Scale Panel Text and Icons, the text on the right side of the panel bar seems to go a bit blurry. This didn’t happen on the last release. The update shield sometimes goes wonky too which I assume is related.

	some of the MATE applications don’t have a mint-x icon. engrampa, eye of mate, atril. They could use the GNOME icons.
