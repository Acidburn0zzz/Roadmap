	- Selecting Encrypted Home Folder Always Breaks Swap https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1367392
	- please bring back the “Mint-X-Dark” icon set. its important for dark themes..
	- uim and uim-byeoru combination give us a good process but , uim installs only uim itself , we need key instance to define keys to input language. installing other packages supported by uim category , it install 19 more packages we just need one more package “uim-byeoru” with “uim”
	- nabi is still beloved input method for korean , and the research shows it clearly , could you add nabi as input method to mintlocale please?
	- mdmsetup Under the Welcome Message the text input area for Custom should align on the left hand side with the ‘Welcome’ text above it. Either ‘Welcome’ should be moved to the right or the text input area increased to the left to get the correct alignment.
	- for non-english speaking people, it is not possible to change language, nor keyboard settings, when starting livemedia.
	- mdm https://github.com/linuxmint/mdm/pull/127
	- gcin couldn’t apply the change of its input method settings, and also the CTRL+SPACE(combine keys that used change bwtween English and Chinese input method) didn’t work well seems these could be fixed by simply update the gcin to ver 2.8.2
	- Pidgin status icon is not showing even if in the settings it’s set to always show.

Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #59
----------------------------------------------
	- cinnamon-settings-users should not let root modify user's passwords when their home is crypted
	- expo trash icon isn't sized properly
	- The wireless signal strength of the networks shown changes constantly and the percentage is almost all the time wrong (weak signal networks are shown with 80+% strength and strong signal ones with low percentage).
	- When I refresh the Applets cache, the progress windows does not appear correctly, it was just a tiny gray window in the top left corner.
	-  I disabled the recently used Files. After that the menu gets way to wide (it reach nearly to the 17.1 on the wallpaper. There is a text in the menu that says “recently used files are disabled…” (I don’t know the correct words, i use the german language)
	-  I can’t select an alternative mirror for the Ubuntu-Trusty repository.
	- Update Manager icon in bottom panel does not scale with the size of the panel. Increasing the size of the panel does not increase the Update Manager icon (even when all the other icons increase in size…yes I ticked that box :) ).
	- The login screen always defaults to “Login” rather than the user. In my case I have one user on the system and it should default to that user so I don’t have to continually click on my user to input the password.
	- settings/backgrounds Gradient and Picture Aspect text not aligned on the left side.
	- settings/backgrounds Consider aligning the dropdown boxes for Gradient and Picture Aspect to each other.
	- settings/panel Under Auto-hide panel consider aligning the two input boxes to each other (+/- milliseconds input buttons) but keep Show Delay and Hide Delay aligned with each other on the left side.
	- settings/preferedapps Consider little bit more spacing under the Terminal dropdown to balance the window elements a bit.
	- If I disable the desktop icons with the first checkbox in cinnamon-settings the right mousebutton does not work on the desktop anymore…
	- On screen keyboard applet – the tray button does not send the keyboard to the tray, otherwise the applet works fine.
	- Accessibility settings, typing, turning on-screen keyboard on or off does not appear to do anything. 
	- Screen reader did not appear to do anything, even after installing orca.
	- Account details: Cinnamon 17, by default link: http://s26.postimg.org/armd84n21/Screenshot_from_2014_11_17_10_04_05.png, 17.1 by default: http://s26.postimg.org/gyxr8ait5/Screenshot_from_2014_11_17_10_35_12.png
	- If changing the mouse pointer from default white to black (e.g Adwaita), it shows up as white during startup. After login, it changes to black.
	- Usint mint-x aqua theme when you maximize windows they go behind panel. Default theme doesn’t do this. I haven’t tried others.
