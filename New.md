		- uim and uim-byeoru combination give us a good process but , uim installs only uim itself , we need key instance to define keys to input language. installing other packages supported by uim category , it install 19 more packages we just need one more package “uim-byeoru” with “uim”
		- nabi is still beloved input method for korean , and the research shows it clearly , could you add nabi as input method to mintlocale please?
		- gcin couldn’t apply the change of its input method settings, and also the CTRL+SPACE(combine keys that used change bwtween English and Chinese input method) didn’t work well seems these could be fixed by simply update the gcin to ver 2.8.2

	- Compiz GTK decorator segfaults in Virtualbox
	- Can't make CCSM changes stick
	- Flash video in website doesn't inhibit monitor turning itself off
	- Window Management: * Desktop effects (requires compatible hardware) * No desktop effects (compatible with all hardware)
	- mintdesktop: mate-wm-recovery doesn't always work....
	- caja exits (“normally”) on clicking “smb-network”.
	- mintmenu: After typing when the list of matches accidentally disappears (hovering the mouse in the menu while moving up) there is no way of making it appear again without retyping.
	- mintmenu: Please add a "delete selection" Button for the Search-Field.
	- apturl-gtk apt://pkname doesn't show in the window list
	- a simple ctrl-alt-t shortcut by default for the terminal
	- alt-mouse wheel desktop zoom
	- F1 desktop help launches online MATE help, yelp menu item has same issue as in Cinnamon edition (launches Mint online doc instead of yelp).
	- mintmenu: Sometimes at first launch, icons don't appear.
	- Caja still uses a 3 sec delay at launch. With partial fixes in systemd and caja on runtime dir issues we could probably remove this or reduce it to a single sec.
