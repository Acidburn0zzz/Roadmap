	- uim and uim-byeoru combination give us a good process but , uim installs only uim itself , we need key instance to define keys to input language. installing other packages supported by uim category , it install 19 more packages we just need one more package “uim-byeoru” with “uim”

	- mdmsetup Under the Welcome Message the text input area for Custom should align on the left hand side with the ‘Welcome’ text above it. Either ‘Welcome’ should be moved to the right or the text input area increased to the left to get the correct alignment.

Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #59
----------------------------------------------
	- cinnamon-settings-users should not let root modify user's passwords when their home is crypted	
	- The wireless signal strength of the networks shown changes constantly and the percentage is almost all the time wrong (weak signal networks are shown with 80+% strength and strong signal ones with low percentage).
	- When I refresh the Applets cache, the progress windows does not appear correctly, it was just a tiny gray window in the top left corner.
	- I disabled the recently used Files. After that the menu gets way to wide (it reach nearly to the 17.1 on the wallpaper. There is a text in the menu that says “recently used files are disabled…” (I don’t know the correct words, i use the german language)
	- I can’t select an alternative mirror for the Ubuntu-Trusty repository.
	- systray icons (reproducible with mintupdate) in bottom panel does not scale with the size of the panel. Increasing the size of the panel does not increase the Update Manager icon (even when all the other icons increase in size…yes I ticked that box :) ).		
	- Screen reader did not appear to do anything, even after installing orca.	
	- If changing the mouse pointer from default white to black (e.g Adwaita), it shows up as white during startup. After login, it changes to black.
