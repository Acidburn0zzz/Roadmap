New bug reports in Linux Mint 17.2 RC

All editions
------------
	Segfaults in FF/TB after upgrading linux-libc-dev
	update translations
	Add exfat support? exfat-utils exfat-fuse
	backport nvidia 346?

	mintsources
		New PPA archive package browsing. You don’t see if a package is already installed. Checkbox is always empty if you reopen the package list. No error when you install “again”.
		PPA package list should be modal. One wrong click and the window is behind the non responding sources window.
		Installed ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer, then installed grub-customizer directly from the package list (works). Unabled PPA, downgrade foreign packages -> nothing to select from. Uninstalled PPA, refreshed APT cache -> still nothing to select from in downgrade foreign packages. Of course I can uninstall grub-customizer the old fashioned ways.
