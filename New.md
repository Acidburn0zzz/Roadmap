New bug reports in Mint 17 RC

All editions
-------------		
	there is lag in the package manager when you make changes to the list its slow to update the list on screen its like visual tearing this happens in any Distro that uses the Synaptic Package Manager 0.81.1 the older 0.75 builds in fine can we go back to the older version
	The FFmpeg plugin for GStreamer 0.10 is not in the repository and it affects Firefox H.264 playback and other applications you can see http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html for the PPA to install the package gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg all so included in that PPA is a much newer VLC version as well which is a extra bonus it is VLC 2.1.5
	in Evolution. I think it’s down to the Mint-X theme. The email headers are all black, and most of it is barely readable. They display okay though with other themes though.
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/freetype/+bug/1310017 is a bug for Korean users, fixed but not yet released for Ubuntu 14.04. sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:jincreator/freetype && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libfreetype6
	gksu: All items in Administration section (in System Settings) are showing the same sort of freeze. It takes about 1 min for password screen to show up. During that time, I can’t use anything else on desktop. It is completely unresponsive. When I enter my password at the end, everything is working normal again.
	Software Manager. I’ve tried installing Wine metapackage, Chromium and the Pepper flash plugin for Chromium. Downloading goes correctly. But installation of the programs hangs at 99% and does not finish in the Software Manager. Wine did install succesfully while the Software Manager kept hanging.
	Modem manager: is evil and often delays shutdown – should it be disabled by default?	
	MintStick (USB Image Writer): the file open dialog uses different icons to the rest of Cinnamon environment – it looks like Gnome/Nautilus..
	Can't install epson printer https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1320644
	the data at /media/user/ doesn’t get deleted automatically when you eject the CD
	is DNS lost after suspending?
	mintlocale: mintlocale: Apply System-Wide Language – It is always displayed as ‘English, United States’, even if you change it in the list (try with Arabic - UAE)
	mintlocale: Right-to-Left Dialogs – i changed the system language to ‘Arabic, United Arab Emirates’ and the ‘Language Settings’ dialog doesnt show things correctly – http://i.imgur.com/RhKKFhO.png
	mintlocale: * No Keyboard Selection or Navigation – The dialog is only accessible with the mouse and its not possible to use the arrow keys to select an entry in the language list or use tab to jump through the dialog elements

Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #146
---------------------------------------------				
	chromium: After watching a full screen video (for example on Youtube) the panels are disappearing (the browser window hides them).	
	Nemo conflicts with fcitx, the best chinese input method. I can’t rename anything in Nemo with fcitx.
	the zoom doesn’t zoom IN on a reboot after you activate it. however, if you first zoom OUT, all works as advertised after that.	
	Cinnamon isn’t scaling user defined panel sizes properly. If I select Numix as my theme and set a customised panel size, when clicking Allow Cinnamon to Scale Panel Text and Icons, the text on the right side of the panel bar seems to go a bit blurry. This didn’t happen on the last release. The update shield sometimes goes wonky too which I assume is related.
	In Cinnamon, desktop font (and only on desktop) looks like it’s antialiased wrong, like it’s using wrong pixel order – BGR instead of RGB. Font settings isn’t helping because desktop font isn’t changing no matter what option I choose.

MATE Edition - last processed comment: #150
-----------------------------------------	
	some of the MATE applications don’t have a mint-x icon. engrampa, eye of mate, atril. They could use the GNOME icons.
	When you choose a theme with a dark panel like Shiki-wise and enable “show hide buttons”, the panel itself changes to the dark theme, but the hide buttons keep the standard silvery look. So choosing a dark theme and enabling the hide button gives rather ugly and inconsistent results.	
	there seems to be a bug in gthumb: pictures in preview are not sharpened, even if i set resolution to high in program settings.	
	hibernation mode is missing
	in the appearance: you should be able to change the icon of the mouse pointer e.g. bigger or smaller, black or white, but this doesn’t work. It’s in Control Center -> Appearance Preferences -> Customize Theme -> Pointer.
