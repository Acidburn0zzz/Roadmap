New bug reports in Mint 17 RC

All editions
-------------		
	there is lag in the package manager when you make changes to the list its slow to update the list on screen its like visual tearing this happens in any Distro that uses the Synaptic Package Manager 0.81.1 the older 0.75 builds in fine can we go back to the older version
	The FFmpeg plugin for GStreamer 0.10 is not in the repository and it affects Firefox H.264 playback and other applications you can see http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html for the PPA to install the package gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg all so included in that PPA is a much newer VLC version as well which is a extra bonus it is VLC 2.1.5	
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/freetype/+bug/1310017 is a bug for Korean users, fixed but not yet released for Ubuntu 14.04. sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:jincreator/freetype && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libfreetype6
	Software Manager. I’ve tried installing Wine metapackage, Chromium and the Pepper flash plugin for Chromium. Downloading goes correctly. But installation of the programs hangs at 99% and does not finish in the Software Manager. Wine did install succesfully while the Software Manager kept hanging.
	Modem manager: is evil and often delays shutdown – should it be disabled by default?		
	Can't install epson printer https://bugs.launchpad.net/linuxmint/+bug/1320644
	the data at /media/user/ doesn’t get deleted automatically when you eject the CD

Cinnamon Edition - last processed comment: #146
---------------------------------------------					
	Nemo conflicts with fcitx, the best chinese input method. I can’t rename anything in Nemo with fcitx.
	the zoom doesn’t zoom IN on a reboot after you activate it. however, if you first zoom OUT, all works as advertised after that.	
	Cinnamon isn’t scaling user defined panel sizes properly. If I select Numix as my theme and set a customised panel size, when clicking Allow Cinnamon to Scale Panel Text and Icons, the text on the right side of the panel bar seems to go a bit blurry. This didn’t happen on the last release. The update shield sometimes goes wonky too which I assume is related.
	
MATE Edition - last processed comment: #150
-----------------------------------------	
	some of the MATE applications don’t have a mint-x icon. engrampa, eye of mate, atril. They could use the GNOME icons.
	When you choose a theme with a dark panel like Shiki-wise and enable “show hide buttons”, the panel itself changes to the dark theme, but the hide buttons keep the standard silvery look. So choosing a dark theme and enabling the hide button gives rather ugly and inconsistent results.	
	there seems to be a bug in gthumb: pictures in preview are not sharpened, even if i set resolution to high in program settings.	
	hibernation mode is missing
	in the appearance: you should be able to change the icon of the mouse pointer e.g. bigger or smaller, black or white, but this doesn’t work. It’s in Control Center -> Appearance Preferences -> Customize Theme -> Pointer.
