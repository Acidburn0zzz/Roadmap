New bug reports in Mint 17 RC

All editions
-------------		
	there is lag in the package manager when you make changes to the list its slow to update the list on screen its like visual tearing this happens in any Distro that uses the Synaptic Package Manager 0.81.1 the older 0.75 builds in fine can we go back to the older version
	The FFmpeg plugin for GStreamer 0.10 is not in the repository and it affects Firefox H.264 playback and other applications you can see http://www.webupd8.org/2014/04/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu.html for the PPA to install the package gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg all so included in that PPA is a much newer VLC version as well which is a extra bonus it is VLC 2.1.5
	in Evolution. I think it’s down to the Mint-X theme. The email headers are all black, and most of it is barely readable. They display okay though with other themes though.
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/freetype/+bug/1310017 is a bug for Korean users, fixed but not yet released for Ubuntu 14.04. sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:jincreator/freetype && sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y libfreetype6
	gksu: All items in Administration section (in System Settings) are showing the same sort of freeze. It takes about 1 min for password screen to show up. During that time, I can’t use anything else on desktop. It is completely unresponsive. When I enter my password at the end, everything is working normal again.
	Software Manager. I’ve tried installing Wine metapackage, Chromium and the Pepper flash plugin for Chromium. Downloading goes correctly. But installation of the programs hangs at 99% and does not finish in the Software Manager. Wine did install succesfully while the Software Manager kept hanging.
	Modem manager: is evil and often delays shutdown – should it be disabled by default?
	gksu I suspect it’s an issue with the open source AMD GCN drivers and Mesa 10.1 not liking fading to grey. It wasn’t an problem under Mint 16 with Mesa 10.2 and associated packages from the Oibaf PPA, but I can’t find a PPA with Mesa 10.2 now, and the Oibaf PPA with Mesa 10.3 is bad news on my machine.	
	MintStick (USB Image Writer): the file open dialog uses different icons to the rest of Cinnamon environment – it looks like Gnome/Nautilus..

	After watching a full screen video (for example on Youtube) the panels are disappearing (the browser window hides them). This problem seems to be related with Cinnamon 2.2 as I had the same issue when used Cinnamon 2.2 in Ubuntu via a PPA.
	Pidgin status icon is not showing (only a placeholder) even if in the settings it’s set to always show. (I use Mint-X dark icon theme). I found a workaround for it: I have to go to Pidgin settings and then set “Never show” and “Show always” again.		
	Nemo conflicts with fcitx, the best chinese input method. I can’t rename anything in Nemo with fcitx.
	the zoom doesn’t zoom IN on a reboot after you activate it. however, if you first zoom OUT, all works as advertised after that.
	screensaver: If using dark theme (I’m FlatStudioDark and I already tried with other dark theme too), there is black/dark horizontal box surrounding the clock and lock dialog. http://i.imgur.com/jrW5DoA.jpg
	Cinnamon isn’t scaling user defined panel sizes properly. If I select Numix as my theme and set a customised panel size, when clicking Allow Cinnamon to Scale Panel Text and Icons, the text on the right side of the panel bar seems to go a bit blurry. This didn’t happen on the last release. The update shield sometimes goes wonky too which I assume is related.
