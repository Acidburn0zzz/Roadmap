New bug reports in Linux Mint 17.2 RC

All editions
------------
	Segfaults in FF/TB after upgrading linux-libc-dev
	update translations
	Add exfat support? exfat-utils exfat-fuse
	backport nvidia 346?

	mintsources: Installed ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer, then installed grub-customizer directly from the package list (works). Unabled PPA, downgrade foreign packages -> nothing to select from. Uninstalled PPA, refreshed APT cache -> still nothing to select from in downgrade foreign packages. Of course I can uninstall grub-customizer the old fashioned ways.
