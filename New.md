	- Just a minor typo in the installer slidershow: “können mir VLC abgespielt werden” should be “können mit VLC abgespielt werden”. (fixed in LP)
	- in the German default login screen, the text “Bitte geben Sie Ihren Benutzernamen ein” (please enter user name) still runs out of bottom of the grey box – only minor decoration problem, still readable.
	- Can't open settings, appearance.. from whisker
	- Can't log out/shutdown from app menu
	- Menu doesn’t update automatically to include KDE applications. Installed kate and krusader (most useful file manager ever!)
	- open Preferences -> Window Manager -> Keyboard change Workspace2 to Alt+F2. Will be asked for replace “xfce4-appfinder –collapsed” application shortcut. Surely, “Use Workspace 2″ … but it has no effect. Still, xfce4-appfinder used for Alt+F2 Moreover – I can’t unbind Alt+F2:xfce4-appfinder behavior at all. Preferences -> Keyboard -> Application Shortcuts doesn’t allow me – rebinding or removing has no effect.
	- Many config-type things in the menu are missing from xfce4-settings-manager. Examples are mdmsetup; Languages; and ‘Users and groups’.
	- During install, in the window for selecting/creating partitions, it says “Linux Mint 16″. 	I suppose this should be “Linux Mint 17″ instead.
	- the package ‘mint-stylish-addon’ contains an obsolete and Broken version of stylish. Is this package still needed?
	- the application menu button really needs a Linux Mint icon :-) 
	- the package ‘mint-flashplugin-10.2′ containing the non-SSE2 version of adobe flash is missing. Can it be restored or are our older Athlon systems being kicked to the curb? BTW Google Chrome also requires SSE2 capable processors now :-( .
	- using the Application Menu, the ‘Run Program’, ‘Help’ and ‘About Xfce’ options are missing
	- requirements in announcements look funny
