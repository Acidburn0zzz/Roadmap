- Ctrl+L switch the visibility of the pathbar
- Rename "View location entry" to "Always show location entry".
- Move breadcrumb/location_entry to a new toolbar within the right view pane (similar to Caja)
- Open as root
- Open terminal
- Check MD5
- Create an actions API, which reads desktop files in /usr/share/nemo/launchers. A action is basically a text file which defines a name, an icon, an executable and which file extensions nemo shows the action for when the file is right-clicked. A typical example of this would be a "Edit tags" action which would apply to *.mp3 files.
