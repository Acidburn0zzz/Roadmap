Not a bug 
---------
	- settings/backgrounds Consider aligning the dropdown boxes for Gradient and Picture Aspect to each other.

Outside of the scope
--------------------
	

Can't reproduce
---------------
	- mdm: The login screen always defaults to “Login” rather than the user. In my case I have one user on the system and it should default to that user so I don’t have to continually click on my user to input the password.					
	

Upstream
--------		
	- caribou: the tray button does not send the keyboard to the tray, otherwise the applet works fine.
