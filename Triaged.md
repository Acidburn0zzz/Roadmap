Not a bug 
---------
	L5 updates listed in the Update Manager, which others have already mentioned. Probably due to the fact that they are listed as security updates, that they are overriding the Visibility settings


Outside of the scope
--------------------
	guvcview doesnâ€™t record video. It just records weird stop motion kind of stuff.
	virt-manager did not have the packages it needed on first boot.
	Dolphin Wii Emulator is not in the repos.
	If i watch a youtube video in full screen mode and come back to normal mode then my chrome is hiding the bottom panel/taskbar. This is not happening with firefox.

Can't reproduce
---------------
	when modifying settings in the Security Centre, I noticed that some minimized windows could not be maximized again. They were visible in the task bar but could not be selected.
