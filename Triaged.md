Not a bug
---------
	mintsources: It would be nice if we could have a better error message in Software sources dialogbox when someone tries to add a ppa that doesn't exist, or have misspelled the name, currently is says something cryptic about 'No JSON object could be decoded' which is not exactly user-friendly
	Add exfat support? exfat-utils exfat-fuse (not done due to licensing reasons)

Outside of the scope
--------------------
	Build Xfwm4 with libepoxy0 and libepoxy-dev
	No hibernation in MDM
